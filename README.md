    <h1>Welcome to Justin's GitHub Portfolio!</h1>
    
Hi there, and thanks for visiting my GitHub page! My name is Justin, and I'm a programmer with a passion for developing projects in my free time. Here are a few of the projects that I've been working on lately:

    <h2>Monte Carlo Analysis</h2>
This project was a challenging and rewarding experience for me, as I love working with statistics and data analysis. I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate a variety of different scenarios, and then analyzed the results to gain insights and identify patterns. Some of the scenarios I explored included [INSERT SPECIFIC SCENARIOS], and I was able to uncover some fascinating insights along the way.

    <h2>Blackjack</h2>
This project was a fun and engaging way to explore my programming skills. I developed a simple blackjack game using Python, and it was a great opportunity to experiment with different coding strategies and learn more about probability.

In addition to these projects, I'm always working on new ideas and expanding my skillset. I'm passionate about programming and always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a developer.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about coding!

Best regards,

Justin
