# Justin's GitHub Portfolio Hi there, and thanks for visiting my GitHub page! My name is Justin, and I'm a programmer with a passion for developing projects in my free time. ## Projects Here are a few of the projects that I've been working on lately: ### Monte Carlo Analysis This project was a challenging and rewarding experience for me, as I love working with statistics and data analysis. I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate a variety of different scenarios, including **Bitcoin future price forecasts**, and **averaging four iterations of a Monte Carlo Simulation**. Through this analysis, I uncovered some fascinating insights and patterns. ### Blackjack This project was a fun and engaging way to explore my programming skills. I developed a simple blackjack game using Python, and it was a great opportunity to experiment with different coding strategies and learn more about game development. I also added some fun graphics and sound effects to make the game more immersive. ## Contact In addition to these projects, I'm always working on new ideas and expanding my skillset. I'm passionate about programming and always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a developer. Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about coding! To showcase my work in a more beautiful and visually appealing way, I have also created an HTML file version of this README.md. You can view it [here](https://example.com).
